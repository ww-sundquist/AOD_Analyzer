The goal of this AOD analyzer is to measure the lifetime of the short-lived neutral Kaon
or "K-short" and perhaps also the Lambda. I think I will end up needing to use the scheme
of Banerjee et al.'s paper (2021) on Determining the lifetime of long-lived particles at
the HL-LHC. These files need to be run from the src/ directory of a CMSSW_10_6_18/
working area with CMS environment set up.
